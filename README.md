# MSSQL_DBATools
A collection of T-SQL scripts useful for day-to-day system DBA work.

I have a number of private repositories with my scripts in. This project is to share the more useful ones publically, once I have made sure that any GDPR-compromising or commercially sensitive material has been stripped and the scripts are properly anonymous and minimally commented.
